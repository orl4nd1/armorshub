# Armors Hub 🕴🏻

With this plugin you will be able to give the users of your server an armor color depending on the permission they have, for example with armorshub.red they will get red, armorshub.green will get green and so with most colors, you can see the EventClass for the full list.

Extremely old plugin, added to my github for my clients to see as development, may have bugs, functions, variables or programming methods that I don't use, but it's better to have a base for them to see than nothing.
